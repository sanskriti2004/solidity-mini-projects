# 🧱 Solidity Mini Projects

A collection of beginner level smart contracts built with **Solidity** to explore and understand core concepts of blockchain development. Each project demonstrates a specific feature or idea — perfect for learning and experimentation!

---

## 📁 What's Inside

- ✅ **Basic Smart Contracts** – Learn how contracts work, store data, and interact.  
- 🔐 **Ownership & Access Control** – Practice `require`, modifiers, and access logic.  
- 💸 **Payments & Transfers** – Implement `payable` functions and Ether transfers.  
- 🗳️ **Voting & Structs** – Use mappings, arrays, and structs for real-world logic.  
- 🧪 **Testing Ready** – Contracts are ready for testing on Remix or with a framework of your choice.
